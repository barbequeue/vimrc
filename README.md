# vimrc
This is the full [amix configuration](https://github.com/amix/vimrc), but with some difference:
* In order to manage plugins more easily, moved to [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* Cursor movement in insert mode - use Ctrl+hjkl
## Install
1. Clone
```
git clone https://github.com/barbequeue/vimrc.git ~/.vim
```
2. Run
```
sh install_vimrc.sh
```
3. Start Vim and run
```
:PlugInstall
```
And you're done!
